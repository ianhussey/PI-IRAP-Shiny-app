<h1>Calculate PI<sub>IRAP</sub> scores for the IRAP</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This Shiny app can be used to calculate PI<sub>IRAP</sub> for data generated by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. The PI<sub>IRAP</sub> is an alternative scoring algorithm to the D score (Greenwald et al., 2003), based on a more robust effect size measure, the PI (Thas et al., 2012). For an article length discussion of the PI<sub>IRAP</sub>, see (De Schryver, Hussey, De Neve, Cartwright, & Barnes-Holmes (under review: see OSF page for pre print).</p>

<h2>Data Formatting</h2>

<p>Please note that this app is for scoring data, but not for cleaning it. The raw data produced by a given implementation of the IRAP (e.g., the Visual Basic 6 IRAP distributed by Dermot Barnes-Holmes; or the Open Source IRAP created by Ian Hussey: see http://osf.io/kg2q8) must be processed into the necessary format before it can be scored. Note that some implementations of the IRAP may be more ameniable to this processing, depending on the format of its output.</p>

<p>As such, the data must first be processed into a specific format in order to work with this app. First, the data must be uploaded as a .csv file (sep=";", dec=","). Second, this file must contain data from the IRAP test blocks only. Third, variables names should be included on the first row, and must include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID - the participant identifier</li>
  <li>PR - the block pair number</li>
  <li>TN - the trial number</li>
  <li>CR - the block within the block pair (i.e., consistent or inconsistent)</li>
  <li>CO - accuracy (either 0 or 1)</li>
  <li>LA - reaction time</li>
  <li>TT - trial type</li>
</ul>
