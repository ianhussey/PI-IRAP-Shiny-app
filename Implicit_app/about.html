<h1>Calculate PI<sub>IRAP</sub> scores for the IRAP</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This Shiny app can be used to calculate PI<sub>IRAP</sub> for data generated by the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure. The PI<sub>IRAP</sub> is an alternative scoring algorithm to the D score (Greenwald et al., 2003), based on a more robust effect size measure, the PI (Thas et al., 2012). For an article length discussion of the PI<sub>IRAP</sub>, see (De Schryver, Hussey, De Neve, Cartwright, & Barnes-Holmes (under review: see OSF page for pre print).</p>
<p>Please note that this app is for scoring data, but not for cleaning it. The raw data produced by a given implementation of the IRAP must be processed into the necessary format before it can be scored. Note that some implementations of the IRAP may be more ameniable to this processing, depending on the format of its output.</p>

<h2>Data Formatting</h2>

<p>The data must be uploaded as a .csv file (sep=";", dec=","). Variables names should be included on the first row, and must include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID - the participant identifier</li>
  <li>PR - the block pair number</li>
  <li>TN - the trial number</li>
  <li>CR - the block within the block pair (i.e., consistent or inconsistent)</li>
  <li>CO - accuracy (either 0 or 1)</li>
  <li>LA - reaction time</li>
  <li>TT - trial type</li>
</ul>
